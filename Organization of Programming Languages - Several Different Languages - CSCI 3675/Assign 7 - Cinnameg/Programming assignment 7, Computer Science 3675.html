<h3>Purpose of this assignment <hr class="heading"></h3>

<p>This is an exercise in defining and using a type 
with multiple constructors.  The language is Cinnameg.
</p>

<h3>
  The assignment
  <hr class="heading">
</h3>

<p>Assignment 4 discusses derivatives.  This assignment is to do
the same thing using a type Expression to represent expressions.
The language is Cinnameg.
<p>

<p>Start with <a href="deriv.cmg">deriv.cmg</a>.
The expression type currently handles constants, xx (the
independent variable), and addition.
Extend type Expression and function $.
Extend functions derivative and
simplify that they handle subtraction,
multiplication and power, as in assignment 4.
</p>

<p>So that everybody
uses the same names (making programs easier for me to test) use
operator &minus; for subtraction, operator * for multiplication and
operator ^ for exponentation.  Design your program so that each of
these operators takes two expressions as parameters.
</p>

<p>Be careful about types.  0 is a number, not an expression.
The corresponding expression is constant(0).
</p>


<h3>Important notes <hr class="heading"></h3>

<p><b>Note.</b> The program is broken into two parts.  deriv.cmg 
implements expressions, derivatives and the simplifier.  File 
<a href="testderiv.cmg">testderiv.cmg</a>
contains a tester.  Extend it to do more tests.  
<b>Be sure to test your new code!</b>
</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> You are only supposed to deal with
<i>constant</i> powers.  
If your deriv function is asked to produce the derivative of an
expression where the exponent is not constant, it should fail.
File deriv.cmg has an <i>exception</i> called derivativeX defined in it.
You can indicate failure to compute the derivative of expression
<i>e</i> using expression fail(derivativeX(e)), as in
<pre>
  &hellip;
  else deriv(e) = fail(derivativeX(e))
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> Internal documentation is important in any
program, and it is important that it be correct.
When you make modifications, keep the documentation
up to date.  <b>Failure to do so will cause you to lose points.</b>
</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> Pay attention to what you are writing.  I have
received submissions for this assignment containing &quot;facts&quot; such
as 
<ul>
  <li> 0*<i>x</i> = <i>x</i></li>
  <li> <i>x</i><sup>0</sup> = <i>x</i></li> 
  <li> <i>x</i><sup>0</sup> = 0</li>
  <li> 0<tt>-</tt><i>x</i> = <i>x</i></li>
</ul>
and assorted other goodies.  
(By the way, 0<sup>0</sup> is undefined.  It is not terribly
important how your program handles that problem.  If you
treat <i>x</i><sup>0</sup> as 1, that is okay.  But in unusual cases,
it can lead to some serious problems.)
</p>

<p><b>Note.</b> To compute a real number to a real power, use operator
<tt>^*</tt>.  It computes powers using logarithms and exponentials.
(<i>x</i>^*<i>y</i> = exp(<i>y</i> ln(<i>x</i>)).)  You can still call
your expression exponentiation operator <tt>^</tt>.
</p>


<h3>Submitting the program <hr class="heading"></h3>

<p>Submit both of your programs, the derivative finder and the tester,
in the usual way, using the submit command.  Be sure to indicate that
the assignment number is 7.  So use command
<pre>
  ~abrahamsonk/3675/bin/submit 7 deriv.cmg testderiv.cmg
</pre>
Command
<pre>
   ~abrahamsonk/3675/bin/submit 7
</pre>
will tell you what you have submitted.
