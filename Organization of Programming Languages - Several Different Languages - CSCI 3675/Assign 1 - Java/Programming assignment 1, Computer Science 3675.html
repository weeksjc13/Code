<h3>
  Purpose of this assignment
  <hr class="heading">
</h3>

<p>This assignment is intended to be done using procedural
programming and to form a baseline
so that, when you do assignment 2, you can compare
procedural programming to equational programming,
at least for these functions.
</p>


<h3>
  Large integer arithmetic 
  <hr class="heading">
</h3>

<p>Arithmetic on large integers can be done by storing an integer
in an array, in binary notation.  Each member of the array 
is either 0 or 1.  Functions can be written to perform operations
such as addition and multiplication.
</p>


<h3> 
  Assignment
  <hr class="heading"> 
</h3>

<p>Write a Java class called Arithmetic in a
file called Arithmetic.java,
with static methods to increment,
add and multiply nonnegative
integers. <span class="red"><b><i>The integers must be represented
in binary as arrays of bytes, with one bit
stored per byte, and with the low order
bit at index 0</i></b></span>.  Use this
<a href="template.txt">template</a>.
</p>

<p>You can add any number of private static methods.
</p>

<p><b>Just in case you missed it,</b>
</p>
<blockquote>
<span class="red"><b><i>the integers must be represented
in binary as arrays of bytes, with one bit
stored per byte, and with the low order
bit at index 0.</i></b></span>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Do not tell me that you did not see that, because you did.</b>
</p>


<p><b>**Note**</b> <b>Please do not include a package line.</b>  If there
is a package line, then I must either put your file into a 
directory whose name matches your package name or I must 
remove the package line.  If your IDE (such as Eclipse) puts
in a package line, just remove it in the version that you submit.
</p>



<h3>
  Requirements 
  <hr class="heading">
</h3>

<p>You are not asked to write a complete application here.
Just define three functions (or methods), for other classes to use.
I will test them by using them in another class.
<i>Do not include a main method.</i>
</p>

<p>Your functions must meet the following requirements.
</p>

<p><ol>
  <li><p>You are not allowed to trivialize the problem by using
  a library that performs arithmetic on large integers.  The idea
  is to program the algorithms.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Your addition and multiplication methods
  must implement something close to the standard
  addition and multiplication algorithms.  It is not acceptable, for
  example, to add <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> by starting at <i>x</i> and 
  doing <i>y</i> increments.
  That is <i>extremely</i> slow.  Similarly, it is not acceptable to multiply
  <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> by adding <i>y</i> to itself <i>x</i> times.  
  That is also much too slow.
  </p>

  <p>The multiplication algorithm that you learned in grade shool
  has you write down all of the intermediate products before adding
  them all up.  It is not necessary to do that.  Just accumulate the
  sum as you generate each intermediate product.  Be sure to shift over
  an appropriate amount.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Your methods must not make any assumptions about how
  large the arrays are, other than those explicitly stated.
  You cannot assume that the numbers fit into a 64-bit integer.
  It is unacceptable to assume
  that the numbers have no more than 100 bits in them.  It must be
  possible to compile your class and put it into a library,
  and find that it can be used for arbitrarily large integers
  <i>without recompiling it</i>.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Say that a binary number is <i>normalized</i> if its most
  significant bit is 1.  As a special case, <b>a normalized representation
  of the number 0 is an array if 0 bytes</b>.
  </p>
  <p>Your methods must produce normalized results.
  They cannot presume, however, that their parameter arrays
  are normalized.  For example, a parameter to the addition
  function might be a number whose high-order bit is 0.
  </p>

  <p><b><i>Pay attention to this requirement.</i></b>  In the
  past, most students have ignored it and lost points as a result.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Your methods must not have requirements that have
  not been stated.  For example, they cannot require that
  the caller perform some initialization that is not explicitly
  stated.  You must use the descriptions given above.  Do not
  add any additional requirements.
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Your methods must not have any visible actions not stated
  in the contracts.  For example, the contracts do not indicate
  that anything is being read or written, so nothing should be read
  or written.  
  </p>
  <p>Your public methods (inc, sum and product)
  cannot change any of the parameter arrays.  They <i>must</i>
  put the result in a new array.  (Private methods can do whatever
  you want them to do.)
  </p></li>

  <li><p>
    Your functions must be thread-safe, meaning that two threads
    can use them concurrently without interfering with each other.
    So your functions cannot use any static variables.  
  </p></li>

  <li><p>Strive for simplicity and elegance in your definitions.
  Try to make them clear and readable. 
  Do not be <i>excessively</i> concerned with efficiency.
  <b><i>Keep it simple.</i></b>
  </p></li>

</ol></p>



<h3>
  Testing the methods
  <hr class="heading">
</h3>

<p>Test your methods thoroughly.  
Do not be satisfied with one or two tests of each method.</b>
In the past, few submissions of this assignment
passed all of the tests that I tried.  Pay attention to
what these methods do when one or both parameters are 0.
Test your methods on parameters that are not normalized.  I will.
</p>

<p>Test your class by writing a separate class ArithmeticTest
that does the testing.  It will have <i>at least</i>
a main method and a method that prints a binary number.
</p>

<p>Here are some recommended tests.  You would be <b><i>well advised</i></b> to
do others as well.  All numbers are in standard binary notation
(high order bit first).  Check the number of bits as well.  The result
of 0 + 0 should have 0 bits.
<ol>
   <li> 0 + 0 = 0</li>
   <li> 0 &times; 0 = 0</li>
   <li> 0 + 1 = 1</li>
   <li> 0 &times; 1 = 0</li>
   <li> 1 + 1 = 10</li>
   <li> 1 &times; 1 = 1</li>
   <li> 10 + 11 = 101</li>
   <li> 10 &times; 11 = 110</li>
   <li> 101001 + 101111100 = 110100101</li>
   <li> 101111100 + 101001 = 110100101</li>
   <li> 101111100 &times; 101001 = 11110011011100</li>
   <li> 111111 + 111111111111 = 1000000111110</li>
   <li> 111111111111 + 111111 = 1000000111110</li>
   <li> 111111 &times; 111111111111 = 111110111111000001</li>
   <li> 111111111111 &times; 111111 = 111110111111000001</li>
   <li> 11111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 + 1 = 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
